**NB :** As of 2025/04/29, only the QuickStart guide, the replication package, SM01, SM02 and SM03 are available. The Python scripts are also provided under `local_utils` directory, but they are not in their final form and should be considered an alpha release. The graphs used in the study are available in a distinct Zenodo Deposit 10.5281/zenodo.15260640 ($\sim50$ Go), including the main dataset $O/RV/RL-O/RV/RL$ (2+ billions of nodes, $\sim4$ billions of edges), and two derived $O-(RV/RL)-O$ graphs ($\sim150$ millions nodes and edges).
